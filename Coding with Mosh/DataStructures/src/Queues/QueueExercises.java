package Queues;
//1 Given an integer K and a queue of integers, write code to reverse the order of the first K elements of the queue.
// Input:  Q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], K = 3
// Output: Q = [30, 20, 10, 40, 50]

//2- Build a queue using a linked list from scratch. Implement the following operations and calculate their runtime complexities.
// -enqueue -dequeue -peek -size -isEmpty

//3- Build a stack using two queues. Implement the following operations and calculate their runtime complexities.
// -push -pop  -peek -size  -isEmpty
